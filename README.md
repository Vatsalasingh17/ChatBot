NoteBot

NoteBot is a Streamlit-based web app that lets you upload your PDF notes and ask questions about them.
It uses LangChain, OpenAI embeddings, and FAISS vector store to split your notes into chunks, embed them, and perform semantic search. The most relevant chunks are then passed to GPT-3.5-Turbo, which answers your questions based on the content of your notes.
